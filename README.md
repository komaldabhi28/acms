Cargo Management is a website designed to computerize the various operations in cargo 
agencies, shipping & transportation companies. This project addresses the 
challenges & complexities associated with cargo handling, tracking, and logistics 
using tech. 
The cargo management system is for transporting goods via air and ship. It can help 
shippers and carriers improve the efficiency of their operations. The system is 
designed to automate the process of managing cargo, from the initial planning stage 
to the final delivery. The system will provide a centralized repository for all cargo-
related information, including cargo manifests, shipping documents, and tracking 
data. It will also provide a variety of tools for managing cargo, such as booking 
shipments, tracking shipments, status of shipments, and generating reports. This can 
help reduce delays and optimize resources.
